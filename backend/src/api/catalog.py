"""Catalog API — the org-scoped parts×decisions grid (W1 step 4).

``GET /api/v1/catalog`` — the lakehouse read surface: one row per part in the
caller's org, each carrying the recommended route, unit cost (withheld on a
blocked route), route-scoped DFM findings, provenance posture, and lifecycle
state (Drafted/Costed). This is what the FE-4 catalog door consumes instead of
joining the raw ``/analyses`` + ``/cost-decisions`` endpoints on the client.

Tenancy: ORG-SCOPED via the ``resolve_org`` boundary W1 step 3 established — the
grid is built only from rows whose ``org_id`` matches the caller's org. A caller
never sees another org's parts (cross-tenant test asserts this by name). Row
derivation lives in ``catalog_service`` (pure, unit-tested); this router owns
only auth, facet parsing, and pagination.

Facets (real query params, applied to real derived fields):
  state=Drafted|Costed · route=<process id> · has_findings=true|false

Pagination: offset-based (``page`` / ``page_size``) with a real ``total`` — the
natural shape for a grid that shows a row count and jumps pages. Saved-view
persistence is intentionally out of scope (read surface first, per plan §4.4).
